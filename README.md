# CS537-FA23-Wisc
## Basic Information
Computer Science 537 (CS537): Operating System. Fall 2023, UW-Madison. 
Lecturer: Louis Oliphant (**[LinkeIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/louis-oliphant)**, [UW-Madison CS homepage](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~oliphant/))   

## Project Information and Suggestions
1. Anticipate 20-40h on each project starting from P2 (our semester have 7 projects, one every two weeks).  
2. Unrelated to the real world (despite shell).  
3. The project writeups are often unclear. Some of which are written based on the solution code.  
4. If you haven't, come to the CS Labs (before 2025 'cause there's a new CS building construction ongoing).  
5. Use chatGPT (preferably GPT-4.0), github, ask for help from the TAs (or Peer Mentors, although sometimes they don't know exactly what's going on).  
6. Anticipate some of the projects from MIT, UCB (I know, and I'm not joking. Expect sometimes more difficult versions compared to these universities')...
7. Start **Early**, but not too early. TAs become really busy near due dates, and sometimes piazza questions are not answered on time by instructors/TAs (maybe a few weeks later). However, sometimes there are changes in project descriptions/resources.  
8. The harder the projects are, the less possible there's any hidden test for them, so passing the given tests are essential.  

## Other Suggestions
1. Be EXTRA careful for instructors without previous records (on rmp, madgrades...).  
2. READ. The [textbook](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/) is very helpful for exams (at least that's what they said, though I didn't get a very high score).  
3. Exams and Projects are not related. The mean of every projects is nearly 100/100, so you HAVE TO do well on **EXAMS** to get an ideal final score. The exams' medians are around 75/100.  
4. Don't expect too much from the peer mentors (especially in semesters when projects are different from past ones).  
5. TAs differ from one another. Some are helpful, some just want to test whether you understand the concept instead of helping you directly (on projects).
